# Notes-App
This is a simple Notes App built from scratch using node.js
The app was built using node.js and basic npm modules. The npm_modules folder has not been included.
In order to be able to run this app, after you take a checkout on your local machine, simply run the command 'npm install' from your terminal window  on a Mac.
There should be a similar command for windows or linux which you can easily google.
